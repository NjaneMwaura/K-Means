# K-Means
Using K-Means for clustering
This project demonstrates the application of K-Means clustering on the Iris dataset and compares the clustering results to the actual species labels using both a confusion matrix and 3D scatter plots. The project highlights the capabilities and limitations of unsupervised learning when applied to a labeled dataset.
